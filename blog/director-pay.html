        Is the UK Moving Toward a US‑Style Model of Director Pay?

        The Financial Reporting Council’s updated guidance on non‑executive director remuneration marks a subtle but meaningful shift in UK governance practice. Released in November 2025, the update clarifies that companies may remunerate non‑executive directors in shares and even encourage them to build personal shareholdings, framing equity‑based pay as a legitimate tool for strengthening alignment with shareholders. This may seem like a technical adjustment, but it represents a philosophical pivot. For decades, the UK has maintained a strict separation between executive and non‑executive pay: executives receive performance‑linked incentives, while non‑executives receive fixed fees to preserve independence. The FRC’s previous guidance discouraged share‑based components for non‑executives, but the new language softens that stance and acknowledges that equity can reinforce long‑term commitment. In doing so, the UK edges closer to the US model, where it is standard practice for non‑executive directors to receive a significant portion of their compensation in equity, typically restricted stock. In the US, this is not seen as a threat to independence but as good governance, and the FRC’s update moves the UK in that direction by legitimising share‑based remuneration and encouraging personal shareholding expectations, even if the UK still avoids performance‑linked awards for non‑executives.

        The motivations behind the FRC’s shift are clear. The UK is under pressure to increase its competitiveness as a listing venue, particularly relative to the United States. Regulators have been asked to support economic growth and reduce perceived “red tape,” and the FRC’s broader mandate now explicitly includes supporting the UK’s attractiveness to global capital markets. The update also reflects market reality: many companies were already informally encouraging non‑executive directors to hold shares, and the FRC is now codifying a practice that had become increasingly common. The FRC emphasises that shareholding can strengthen alignment between directors and shareholders, reinforcing long‑term stewardship — a rationale long embraced in the US. Taken together, these factors explain why the FRC has chosen this moment to modernise its guidance.

        While the UK is not adopting the US model wholesale, the direction of travel is unmistakable. The update signals greater flexibility in how non‑executive directors may be paid, greater alignment with shareholder interests, and greater recognition of global competition for board talent. The UK is not becoming the US, but it is becoming less distinct from it — and in a market concerned about companies drifting toward New York, this recalibration is strategic rather than symbolic.
