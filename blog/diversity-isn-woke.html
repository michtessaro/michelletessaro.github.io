        Diversity Isn’t Woke. It’s Wise.

    <p>Donald Trump’s war on “wokeism” may be American in origin, but UK business leaders are feeling the pressure. Quietly, and sometimes not so quietly, companies are pulling back from diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts—scrubbing inclusive language from websites, shelving internal targets, and dialling down DEI disclosures in annual reports.</p>

    <p>This shift isn’t driven by data. It’s driven by politics. The business case for diversity hasn’t changed. What has changed is how it's being framed. Once seen as a tool for innovation, resilience, and good governance, DEI is now dismissed in some quarters as ideological overreach. Expanding opportunity is being rebranded as lowering standards. Diversity, we’re told, is the enemy of meritocracy.</p>

    <p>That argument is seductive. And wrong.</p>

    <p>The backlash was always coming. For some, DEI moved too fast. For others, too slowly. Those historically excluded still face invisible walls. Meanwhile, those who’ve long benefited from the system are being told they’ll need to share not just space—but power.</p>

    <p>Let’s be honest: DEI has drifted. What began as a focused push to bring more women into leadership has expanded into a sprawling agenda—race, neurodiversity, class, sexual orientation, and more. That expansion was overdue. But it also blurred the message. As the “why” gave way to the “how,” we ended up with box-ticking, bias training, and language-policing—an easy target for critics eager to dismiss the entire enterprise.</p>

    <p>In the noise, we’ve forgotten why diversity was introduced in the first place.</p>

    <p>In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers and governance experts highlighted the dangers of groupthink in boardrooms dominated by white, male, privately educated insiders. Diversity wasn’t just a moral gesture. It was a governance fix—intended to broaden perspectives, challenge consensus, and improve decision-making.</p>

    <p>Put differently: diversity was brought in to safeguard meritocracy, not undermine it.</p>

    <p>If hiring the “best person for the job” is the goal, it matters who gets the opportunity to compete. When career advancement still flows through familiar schools, accents, and networks, we’re not rewarding merit—we’re recycling privilege. Familiarity becomes the proxy for performance. And when that happens, meritocracy is little more than a myth.</p>

    <p>Done well, diversity doesn’t dilute standards—it reveals them. It forces organisations to confront structural blind spots and biases that cause them to miss out on talent. It opens the aperture, ensuring that recruitment and promotion reflect potential, not pedigree. Without diversity, we are only ever choosing the “best” from a narrow and self-replicating pool.</p>

    <p>Some UK companies seem to be forgetting this. In the 2025 earnings season, several FTSE-listed firms quietly reduced DEI content in their annual reporting. WPP removed diversity references from its pay disclosures and reports. GSK dropped its public DEI targets, citing global compliance concerns. Rolls-Royce scaled back DEI globally. These aren’t isolated moves—they signal a wider corporate retreat.</p>

    <p>The regulators are also blinking. In March, the Financial Conduct Authority dropped its proposed diversity reporting rules for larger firms after industry pushback. What was meant to embed accountability has instead been parked, citing fears of overreach and administrative burden. But the costs of inaction—homogenous leadership, shallow talent pipelines, and reputational risk—don’t vanish just because they’re no longer counted.</p>

    <p>That’s the real problem: DEI was never fully embedded to begin with. Too often, it has been sidelined—tucked into HR, confined to training modules, or deployed for external optics—while the core systems of recruitment, reward, and leadership development remained untouched. If diversity is to survive this moment, it must move from the margins to the mainstream.</p>

    <p>So let’s get back to basics.</p>

    <p>Diversity means casting the net wide when hiring—basic risk management. Equity means tailoring support to develop talent—good leadership. Inclusion means creating environments where people can contribute fully—key to any high-performing team.</p>

    <p>This isn’t about favouring one group over another. It’s about making sure organisations don’t miss or undervalue talent because it doesn’t look, sound, or operate like the traditional model. The best organisations are already doing this—not out of ideology, but out of necessity.</p>

    <p>A country facing demographic decline, skills shortages, and global competition cannot afford to overlook half its potential. If we’re serious about meritocracy, then DEI isn’t a distraction. It’s the system check that ensures merit can rise.</p>

    <p>The real risk isn’t that DEI goes too far—it’s that we give up before we’ve truly embedded it. We’ve seen what happens when leadership teams are homogenous, and the risks are well documented. Let’s not confuse backlash with evidence.</p>

    <p><strong>DEI isn’t woke. It’s wise. And we’d be foolish to let it fail.</strong></p>
