    <p>President Trump’s vow to eradicate “wokeism” from American workplaces may not have changed UK corporate policy overnight—but its shadow is long. Even in the UK, where DEI policy has typically been voluntary and market-led, a new climate of caution has emerged. Businesses are quietly scaling back DEI commitments, shifting their approach to DEI towards the more neutral language of inclusion, shelving internal targets, declining to discuss diversity in their annual reports and asking whether DEI still deserves boardroom attention.</p>

    <p>This isn’t just about politics. It’s about perception. And perception, right now, is DEI’s biggest liability.</p>

    <p>Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were originally introduced to build fairer, more effective organisations. But for many employees—especially those who benefit from maintaining the status quo—DEI has come to feel anything but fair. The backlash we’re now seeing didn’t begin with Trump, but his intervention gave it shape, language, and permission. What was once a low-level fatigue has become an overt challenge, both to DEI’s value and to the assumptions underpinning it, leaving a powerful counter-narrative to take hold: that DEI is performative at best, and exclusionary at worst.</p>

    <p>That’s how we’ve ended up with a paradox: an initiative built around fairness is now being portrayed by many as unfair.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; margin-top: 50px;">How did we get here?</h2>

    <p>The problem isn’t DEI’s principles. It’s the packaging.</p>

    <p>Over time, the narrative shifted—from why DEI matters to how it should be delivered. Workshops, metrics, and targets became the public face of inclusion, while the underlying rationale—removing barriers, unlocking talent, broadening perspective—was too often left unsaid. DEI became equated with identity checklists, jargon-heavy training sessions, and job appointments that some perceived as unearned. Leadership initiatives for underrepresented groups, though necessary, sometimes gave the impression that others—particularly white men—were being excluded. This opened the door to a powerful, and deeply emotional, counter-narrative: that DEI advantages some groups at the expense of others.</p>

    <p>That narrative is flawed—but it’s also widespread. Our research and ongoing conversations with business leaders and policymakers show how it’s beginning to reshape corporate behaviour—revealing just how fragile DEI initiatives and progress really are. Gains for women or minority groups are misinterpreted as losses for others. This sense of exclusion is compounded by economic pressure and a broader cultural shift toward “pragmatism” and profit-first thinking. It’s no surprise that boardrooms are reconsidering whether DEI still feels like a priority.</p>

    <p>But here’s the truth: when DEI is framed in abstract ideals or politically charged terms, it alienates. When it loses sight of workplace realities and business relevance, it becomes vulnerable. And when the focus moves from deep structural change to superficial branding, it stops being credible.</p>

    <p>That doesn’t mean the answer is to abandon it. But it does mean the moment calls for a reset.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; margin-top: 50px;">A DEI reset</h2>

    <p>A DEI reset doesn’t mean scaling back. It means returning to the fundamentals: fairness, opportunity, and performance. It means communicating clearly and persuasively why diversity is good management, not moral theatre. And it means engaging all employees—not just those in underrepresented groups—so that DEI feels like a shared endeavour, not a special interest.</p>

    <p>The corporate response so far? In many cases, surface-level resets: job titles rewritten, language softened, branding adjusted. But is that enough? Rebranding DEI without reengaging with its purpose doesn’t solve the problem. It risks confirming the suspicion that it was always just PR.</p>

    <p>What’s needed now is not optics—but clarity.</p>

    <p>This isn’t the time for slogans or silence. It’s the time to reclaim the rationale. DEI must be reframed not as a political gesture, but as a leadership tool: about attracting and retaining talent, supporting performance, and building cultures of trust. Not everyone needs to agree on the language—but its value needs to be understood.</p>

    <p>That means shifting the conversation away from abstraction and identity politics, and back to systems: how hiring happens, who gets heard, how decisions are made. DEI is not about favouritism—it’s about fairness. It doesn’t guarantee outcomes. But it does ask that we take a harder look at how opportunity is structured.</p>

    <p>Importantly, the reset must involve new voices, much like the early efforts of the 30% Club, which enlisted Chairmen from the City to champion change. Too often, the responsibility to advocate for DEI has fallen to those who stand to benefit from it. That’s both unfair and ineffective. What’s needed now are leaders—particularly those from majority groups—who can articulate DEI’s value in terms their colleagues understand: resilience, innovation, and long-term competitiveness.</p>

    <p>This is not the time for silence or retreat. It’s the time to recommit—more clearly, more strategically, and with greater empathy—to the reason DEI was introduced in the first place: to build better organisations for everyone.</p>

    <p>This moment of backlash could be an opportunity—if companies are bold enough to use it. A reset won’t come from softening the message. It will come from sharpening it.</p>

    <p><em>Let’s reset it. And reconnect to its purpose.</em></p>
