    <h2>Practice & Research</h2>

    <p>Dr Michelle Tessaro is an internationally experienced senior finance and governance leader whose career spans more than two decades across Canada, Europe, and Asia. She has held senior management and executive roles in multiple sectors, leading business growth, driving profitability, scaling operations, and building high‑performing, operationally focused teams.</p>

    <p>A Visiting Professor at Cranfield School of Management, Michelle’s research sits at the intersection of corporate governance, leadership, and structural equity. Her doctoral work examined the role of women on boards and how board composition influences gender diversity in senior executive pipelines — a topic she continues to explore through applied research, advisory work, and public commentary.</p>

    <p>As a non‑executive, in addition to strong financial oversight and risk management, Michelle is known for her ability to strengthen board effectiveness, challenge constructively, and support organisations through periods of change.</p>

    <p>Central to Michelle’s work is a focus on turning research into practical, actionable guidance for boards, executives, and policymakers. She translates complex academic insights into real‑world decision‑making, helping organisations understand not just what needs to change, but how to change it.</p>

    <p>Her current portfolio blends academic research, board service, and advisory work focused on governance, leadership, and the systems that shape opportunity in organisations.</p>
